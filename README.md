# Practice
A repo for my solutions for various practices challenges I take on.

Solutions are worked out in an ide (i.e. IntelliJ for Java), the test set implemented as a simple Junit tests, and then submitted to the online source to verify, if applicable.

I use the following materials to study with:
* LeetCode
* Cracking the Coding Interview

The solutions are sorted by the questions source, and then named in a way to indicate which question it answers.

I use the Javadocs to record the original name, question, and difficulty.
